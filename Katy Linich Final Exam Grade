General comments:

You showed much learning in this project. I know that you have struggled at times, but I truly believe that
you have mastered many of the fundamentals and just need more practice. I truly hope you will not let this
learning fade away, but will instead find as many opportunities as you can to develop your skills. I know
that you will become more and more comfortable with it every time that you do and will get better at it.
Remember that we went well beyond many of the basic elements that you'll need for most of your work.
It has been a pleasure having you in the course this semester.

Total score: 60



Reproducibilty: 8

Correctly initiated a repo and tracked the project with descriptive comments. Readme file is sparse and not
descriptive for outsiders. No .gitignore created.

Neatness: 8

A well-documented project with appropriate narrative. Adherence to the style guide throughout the notebook.
Readable output, but could have used a few more section headings and provided more narrative with statistics
and graphs for the three research questions.

Functions: 10

Functions work correctly, but they are included in the main notebook and the arguments and output are not
documented.

Data prep: 9

All data read in, but did not check primary keys so did not find bad key in GPA. Correctly scored the Likert
survey data. Did not remove highest residuals. Joined all files.

Graphs: 15

Graphs are attractive, well-labeled, and appropriate for investigating the research questions.

Descriptive statistics: 5

Calculated means for the third question, but did not calculate any descriptive statistics (e.g., correlations)
for the first two questions.

Inferential statistics: 5

Calculated inferential statistics for the third question, but did not calculate any for the first two questions.
